#New Project

##This is a new Project I am working on, I will be creating a Vnet that has several different services 
including virtual machines, multiple subnets, sql database and load balancer with the virtual machines acting as the backend pool. The project will start off small like this with only the Vnet and Network security group, subnet, and resource group.
